- You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Remix, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind.

- Code Style and Structure

  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: follow the standard Remix app structure.
    - loaders go in /app/loaders
    - actions go in /app/actions
    - everything for Remix should go inside /app
    - other root directories are for external data or supporting code.
  - Use fetcher_v3. The json() function is not available.
